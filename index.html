        <p>John graduated Norristown Area High School in 2016; only last year! Currently John is in his first year of college studying Political Science at Temple University. John also currently serves as a Democratic committee-person in West Norrition Township. John and his family are invested in Norristown, John received 13 years of a education from the Norristown Area School Distict, as did his sister. Their mother has worked in the district for 14 years. &nbsp;John has a close relationship to Norristown</p>
        <p>John is only 19 years old, which is a big reason as to why he is running. John has realized that the only way for the Democratic party and progressive ideas to advance, is by embracing younger people into the party. John believes he can bring a new and fresh voice. John is not the voice of one, but many. </p>
        <p>Having only graduated from Norristown Area High School last year, John has a perspective of the district that the Board has ever heard before. John understands how to improve student lives and take this district in a modern direction. Students, staff, and the faculty could appreciate a voice that understands the district from firsthand experiences. </p>
        <p>I ask you to please support my campaign as we aim to get younger people involved in the political process and bring a fresh voice to the board!</p>

                          <p>As one of the more diverse school districts in Pennsylvania, we always must make sure our schools are a welcoming environment for our students and families. As the Latinx population grows in our district, we must make sure that students, who need to be in an ESL classroom, have a seat. Muslim students must feel comfortable in our schools, as should any student apart of the LGBTQ+ community. It is in my experience, that any student can always benefit learning a little more about a group people of people they are not so familiar with. Diversity inclusion lessons should always be encouraged district wide for students and faculty/staff. As a board member, I would always ensure that every student feels comfortable and welcomed in their school and always encourage improvement. <br>

                          <hr class="star-primary">
                          <p>As a student I witnessed, firsthand, the rapid decline of community support and spirit over the past few years. Norristown has always had a rich history of being one community, united by our passionate students, whether out on the field, in the stands, or on the stage. But, I would never blame the community for something that is not their fault. Communication between any Norristown school and the community, seems to only take place when necessary. The community is often unsure of when district events are happening and where to go. A central focus of mine, as a board member, would be to increase communication through a central-command social media account, up-to-date announcements on the district channel, and to make sure teachers and support staff always know of any district event, so they can tell their students. <br>

                          <p>Employees must know they are appreciated if we expect them to provide a meaningful education to our students. When a teacher of mine was specially thanked in some way, by a board member or administrator, for doing an exceptional job, it always meant a lot to them. Appreciating employees, can remind them of their importance and why they do what they do. As a board member, I would always encourage more employee appreciation events and would be in the schools more to let any employee know of how much they matter. Both the teachers and support staff contracts will expire, following the end of the school year. Hopefully negotiations will be swift, but either way I will be a champion for the staff and faculty before and after I am elected. As a son of two union parents, I have, and always will, stand behind the staff and faculty. <br>

                          <p>As technology continues to advance, the job market in that industry is constantly growing. Not only that, student-intertest in that field exists. We need to have a strong computer science program starting in middle school and continuing through high school graduation. We must prepare our students to pursue degrees and careers, that are relevant in the modern world. We will utilize free open-source platforms like CodeAcademy, Code.org &amp; Coursera to help quickly and uniformly introduce these initiatives with no additional cost. </p>
                          <p>Classrooms in most of our schools are already outfitted with numerous forms of technology. As a board member, I would make sure the technology is being used to benefit the students. I would encourage more training for any teacher or support staff member that is not comfortable using any of the technology. Also, any classroom that is not yet equipped with the necessary technology, will be, if I am elected. <br>

                          <hr class="star-primary">
                          <p>I am avid supporter of the education the Norristown Area School District offers, but I recognize there is always room for improvement. Two changes I will champion is a serious review of the English Language Arts (ELA) program at the elementary level and the return of a foreign language program at the middle school level. There is not enough emphasis placed on the importance of developing good writing skills early in a student’s education. I believe writing must be taught as its own entity, separate from the entire ELA curriculum. Great writing skills are needed through an entire life; we are responsible for owing this to our students. </p>
                          <p>A foreign language program at the middle school level will not only benefit students throughout high school, but make them a better candidate for when applying to college and a future career. Learning another language also opens a student up to learning about another culture, always beneficial. <br>

                          <p>One of the main reasons I am running for School Board is to encourage and provide avenues for younger people to get involved in the political process at a local level. I hope that by running for school board, it will energize students to start pursuing their dreams or goals. Most things are attainable in life with the right mindset, no matter what others may think or say. This campaign is a testament to doing just that and a message that age is not a limitation, only a benefit. <br>
